# Metrics Framework
The metrics framework is a Mule application intended to collect, aggregate and load platform metrics into different visualization systems; providing out of the box integrations and visualization options, including useful dashboards and charts.

## Features
- Compact mule application (1 single application)
- Provides more than 100 metrics from 2 complementary domains:
- **Platform Operational Metrics**: collected and calculated automatically based on multiple products from Anypoint Platform: Exchange, Design Center, Runtime Manager, Access Management; covering metrics from applications deployed on-prem (Standalone), RTF and CloudHub.
- **Platform Benefits**: require manual input to calculate final metrics, crossing information from the "Platform Operational" domain

![Domains](/img/domains.png)

### Modes
- Poller (Push mode)
	- Collects, transforms and loads metrics in a defined visualization system
	- Configurable - frequency and status (enabled/disabled).

- API to manage the asset:
	- API endpoint to obtain metrics on-demand (Pull mode)
	- API endpoint for triggering a specific loader to push data to a visualization system
	- API endpoint for loading platform benefits - manual input required
	
### Loader options
    - **CSV**
    - **JSON**
    - **Plain Log**: in case you forward logs to external systems (e.g using Splunk forwarder)
    - **Splunk**: Including an out of the box dashboard with more than 80 charts
	- **Anypoint Monitoring**: Requires Titanium subscription, dashboard is not provided 
	- Tableau: (Not available yet) 
	- ELK: (Not available yet) 


## Installation

### Requirements
- Mule Runtime 4.2.1 or above 
- All deployments models are supported: CloudHub, OnPrem hosted Runtimes, Runtime Fabric 
- Anypoint Platform user with the Organization Administrator role in the master organization and all Sub Orgs you want to collect data 

### Steps

1. Clone or download the project from GitHub `git clone git@github.com:mulesoft-consulting/metrics-framework-m4.git`

2. Adjust the properties, run the project and test it - go to your browser and open `http://localhost:8081/console/`

3. Use the postman collection provided (/postman) to understand the API

4. If you want to run the application using the poller mode, you have to configure some properties

### Properties configurations 

- Default configurations defined in `/src/main/resources/properties/metrics-framework.{env}.yaml`:
- Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data using the Secure Properties Module: https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.2/secure-configuration-properties.
- Default secure config file defined in `/src/main/resources/properties/secure/metrics-framework.{env}.yaml`
- Example `mule.key` used and configured as a Global Property under `global.xml` file


Name | Description | Default Value
------------ | ------------ | ------------
http.port | The port for exposing the metrics-framework API | 8081
poller.enabled | Property to enable or disable the poller to collect and load metrics in external systems | false
poller.frequency | In the case of enabling the poller, this property defines the scheduler frequency in minutes: Recommended to collect metrics once a day | 480
aggregation.raw | Flag to define the format of the final response **False**: Wonâ€™t provide the raw data but final metrics **True**: Will provide raw data to be aggregated outside this asset | false
loader.strategy | In the case of using the poller, this property defines the strategy for loading data in external systems, the options are: **csv, json, logger, splunk, am, elk, tableau** | logger
anypoint.platform.host | Anypoint Platform Host. Change to eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com if using the EU Control Plane or to a private host if using PCE | anypoint.mulesoft.com
auth.username | Anypoint Platform username | 
auth.password | Anypoint Platform password | 
auth.orgId | Anypoint Platform master org Id |

#Some Theory around the Framework
The framework is intended to cover the main areas to define and implement metrics using Mule.

## Framework
### Business Needs

There are several business needs around the definition of metrics. The principal goal is to provide **visibility** on 4 main areas: People/Teams, Projects, Processes and Technology. By having visibility on these areas, the involved stakeholders can make decisions, anticipate technical and non-technical needs and optimize time and resources

### Data Sources

Any system containing raw data

### Measurements 

1. **Basic measurements**: 

Examples:
- Number of projects
- Number of incidents

2. **Complex/Composed measurements**

Examples:
- Average daily-TPS per application/project
- vCores usage per application/project - monthly

3. **Indexes/KPIs**

Examples:
- Growth
- Tendencies
- Efficiency / Performance

### Problem Space

How to link business needs, measurements and data sources?

### Approach - Conceptual

1. **Event**: Canonical object representing a metric, based on dimensions and facts

2. **Collectors**: Processes to Collect raw data from different data sources

3. **Aggregators/Transformers**: Transform (calculate, compose, enrich, build metric/event normalized/denormalized objects

4. **Loaders**: Processes to send/load events into external storages/systems 

5. **Visualization**: Third party systems for showing charts and dashboards based on metrics-events (e.g Microstrategy, Tableau, Splunk dashboards, ELK, custom dashboards, BI software, etc)
